Another important consideration is the selection of values for ANN parameters, which may help the model to avoid overfitting. This task addresses some of the regularization methods, such as **Dropout** and **Batch Normalization**. You will implement these two methods in NumPy."

You need to keep updating your CNN in iterations to get the best possible result. Kaggle will enable you to observe the progress made by students in the class. You can use any deep learning modelling techniques (e.g. regularization, optimization) to get the best possible performance. You have to use TensorFlow 2.4 to build your model."
